# Frequently Asked Questions

Note: Turnitin does not compare matching images or images of graphs and charts. ​Note​: Turnitin does not accept PowerPoint files, media files, or a document with only images.

#### How many Turnitin Similarity Reports can be generated?

According to the Turnitin site, when multiple submissions are permitted \(i.e., Resubmission Assignment​\), only one Similarity Report will be processed in a 24-hour period; reports "for second or subsequent submissions will require a 24 hour delay before the Similarity Report begins processing."

#### Missing Papers?

 Our system does not have the capability to go in to a user’s profile and see what online activity they had on a specific day. If a student believes a paper was submitted to Turnitin but it appears to be missing, we can track the paper with the Paper ID Number from the digital receipt. The digital receipt would have appeared on screen after the student submitted the paper, and may also have been sent via email. Please have the student check his or her junk, spam and trash email folders for the digital receipt email. 

When students submit papers, it is best to make sure they either print out or write down the Paper ID Number when it comes up on screen after the paper is accepted. If they do not see the Paper ID Number, then the paper was not accepted, and they will need to go through the process again. Note: Many students make the mistake of uploading the paper and thinking it’s done. There is a second step, which is to Confirm Submission. If the second step isn't completed, the paper will not be submitted, and there will be no digital receipt.
