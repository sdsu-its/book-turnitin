# What is Turnitin?

Turnitin is a web-based plagiarism detection service and assignment submission platform that allows instructors to easily check student papers for unoriginal material. Instructors can now create assignments within their Blackboard courses that can be submitted directly to Turnitin.

> Turnitin accounts are based on email addresses. When you use Turnitin within Blackboard, it automatically sets up an account based on your email address that Blackboard has on record. If you have used Turnitin in the past, outside of Blackboard, the Blackboard email address may or may not match your previous Turnitin account. So, if you log into Turnitin.com using your pre-Blackboard email address, you may or may not see your Blackboard assignments, depending on whether the email addresses match. Student accounts are also automatically created by Turnitin within Blackboard. If youâ€™ve used Turnitin outside of Blackboard, you had to provide a Class ID and Enrollment Password so the students could join your class. This tedious step is no longer necessary, since the roster is derived from Blackboard.
