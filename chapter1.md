Good news! As of August 1, 2017, SDSU began using Turnitin’s updated interface for reviewing student work to prevent plagiarism with confidence and give great feedback. This updated version, called Feedback Studio​, features a more intuitive, modern design, as well as accessibility improvements and better performance on mobile devices. You’ll experience Feedback Studio when you open up a student’s paper in Turnitin, with the help of a short guided tour in the product. Your students will also experience this new and improved interface when viewing Similarity Reports and receiving your feedback.
