## Different Assignment Types in Turnitin
**Paper Assignment**, which is the base assignment for all other assignments types (PeerMark, Revision, and Reflection). When creating a paper assignment there are three dates that instructors will need to set: the start date, the due date, and the post date.

The **PeerMark Assignment** type allows students to review their peers' papers based on scale and free response questions selected by the instructor.

If you would like students to submit multiple drafts without overwriting the previous drafts/submissions, the instructor can create additional assignments using the **Revision Assignment** type. Revision assignments are duplicates of the 'parent' assignment's advanced options and standard settings, but may have new start, due, and post dates.

> Both a **Revision Assignment** and a **Peer Mark Assignment**
> require an existing initial **Paper Assignment**.
